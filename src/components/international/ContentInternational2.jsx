            <h3>Maritime Transportation:</h3>
            <p>Ensure your next ocean crossing is fully prepared for potential threats. Pirates are not just a thing of the past and when you have valuable, there is no better target. Great for oil rigs, X, and Z. </p>

            <h3>International Resorts:</h3>
            <p>Nothing will tarnish your guests experience and your reputation like an incident. Keep the luxury and fun going without a hiccup when you have the right protection for your resort and guests.</p>

            <h3>Port Security:</h3>
            <p>Private military and security is just the type of protection you need when it comes to jobs big and small. Itâ€™s not worth the risk to have an under-supported team and a partner for unique operations that call for a strong presence.</p>
